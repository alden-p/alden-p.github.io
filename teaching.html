          <h4 class="title">Summer Challenge Economics</h4>
                This was an original course in game theory which I designed and taught as part of BU's Summer Challenge Program. The course was geared towards highschool students and consisted of 10 two-hour lectures.
                Ephasis was placed on interactive learning with particular focus on classroom activities in which students acted as ``players'' in many famous games such as the prisoner's dillemma, the 
                stag hunt, and a version of the market for lemons. The course gave an overview of utility, various games in the context of Nash equilibrium and subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, repeated games and incomplete information.
